# Previous Work
This is a repository of a sample of my previous work, most of which were completed during my Master of Data Science and Analytics program. 
[Automatically generating powerpoint slide decks](https://github.com/claudiachoi/Sample-Projects/blob/master/Automatically%20generating%20powerpoint%20slide%20decks.ipynb) script was created during my time at CAMH to streamline reporting and analytics with a python program that reduced the time required to generate all PowerPoint reports to under 1 minute (6+ reports required per year done manually)
This [dashboard](https://github.com/claudiachoi/Sample-Projects/blob/master/dashboard_sample.pdf) is a sample using dummy data of the visualizations that I produced at Loblaw.
