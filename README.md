# Previous Work
This is a repository of a sample of my previous work, most of which were completed during my Master of Data Science and Analytics program. 

[Automatically generating powerpoint slide decks](https://github.com/claudiachoi/Sample-Projects/blob/master/Automatically%20generating%20powerpoint%20slide%20decks.ipynb) script was created during my time at CAMH to streamline reporting and analytics with a python program that reduced the time required to generate all PowerPoint reports to under 1 minute (6+ reports required per year done manually)

This [dashboard](https://github.com/claudiachoi/Sample-Projects/blob/master/dashboard_sample.pdf) is a sample using dummy data of the visualizations that I produced at Loblaw to help discover business insight and drive decision making.

[Time Series Smoothing and Clustering](https://github.com/claudiachoi/Sample-Projects/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Smoothing%20and%20Clustering.ipynb) is a Lunch and Learn session I presented to the team at Loblaw, highlighting the capability of this method to cut through the noise and uncover hidden trends over time.
